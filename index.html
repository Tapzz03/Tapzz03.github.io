                        To establish a cohesive aesthetic and intuitive navigation for the Wild Uchi website, wireframes were created. 
                        These initial blueprints outlined the page structure and layout. 
                        Using Figma, interactive prototypes were developed, incorporating dynamic elements such as animations, smooth scrolling effects, and product carousels. 
                        This design approach aimed to captivate users visually while ensuring a seamless and enjoyable user experience. 
                        By prioritizing user-centric design principles, the goal was to create a website that not only reflects Wild Uchi's brand identity but also effectively guides visitors through their wellness journey.
